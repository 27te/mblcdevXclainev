Let’s be honest: the hourly model is broken.

When agencies sell time, the incentive is to stretch projects—not to finish them faster, smarter, or better. And from the client’s side, it turns collaboration into a transaction: _“How many hours will this take?”_ instead of _“What will this make possible?”_

At _mblcdev_, we flipped the model:  
**We don’t sell hours. We sell outcomes.**

> “People don’t want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.”  
> — _Theodore Levitt, Harvard Business School_

## 🚫 Time ≠ Value

Spending 40 hours writing messy code is not more valuable than 10 hours of clean architecture.  
And shipping a product in 2 weeks is not _less valuable_ than shipping it in 2 months. On the contrary—speed is leverage.

That’s why we design every proposal around **business outcomes**:

- Launching your MVP in record time
- Building a platform that can scale with your customers
- Turning traffic into conversions, not just into pretty pixels

## ⚡ What Outcome-Driven Work Looks Like

Here’s what we prioritize over hours:

- **Clarity**: Defined goals and metrics of success
- **Speed**: Tight feedback loops, rapid prototyping
- **Ownership**: We take responsibility for the result, not just the task
- **Focus**: We cut features that don’t move the needle

For example, a recent client needed an internal tool to automate PDF generation and contract workflows. Most agencies would estimate 80 hours and stretch it. We delivered a working prototype in 10 days, built on AI + automation, and saved them 200+ manual hours/month.

They didn’t buy time.  
They bought _relief_.  
They bought _scale_.

## 💡 Value-Based Pricing Isn’t “More Expensive”—It’s Smarter

This model benefits **everyone**:

- **Clients** pay for a result that drives ROI, not for how long we sit at our desks.
- **We** get to optimize for quality, not quantity.
- **The relationship** becomes one of partnership, not labor rental.

It’s not a loophole. It’s the future.

As [Jonathan Stark](https://jonathanstark.com/) puts it in his book _Hourly Billing Is Nuts_:

> “Hourly billing rewards inefficiency. It punishes innovation. And it caps your income by the number of hours you can work.”

We believe in creating exponential value—not trading our lives for time.

## 🧠 This is How We Work at _mblcdev_

- We scope projects with outcomes in mind (and ROI on paper).
- We build fast, iterate with precision, and measure everything.
- We don’t hide behind vague milestones—we ship what matters.

If you want to “rent time,” there are thousands of agencies out there.  
If you want **progress**, we’re your people.

📌 Whether you’re building a startup or reinventing your business, ask yourself:

> _Are you paying for hours… or are you investing in outcomes?_

We chose our side.  
And we’re building for clients who do too.
